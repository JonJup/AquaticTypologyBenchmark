Consider a set of $N$ sites classified into $T$ distinct types $t_1, t_2, \dots, t_T \in \tau$, where $\tau$ represents the complete typology system.
Let $x_i$ be a site and $\tau(x_i)$ the function that returns its type assignment.
For any site $x_i$, let $\bar{d}(x_i,\mathbf{x}_{\tau(x_i)})$ represent the mean dissimilarity between $x_i$ and all other sites within its assigned type $\tau(x_i)$.
For any other type $t_x \in \tau \setminus \{\tau(x_i)\}$, let $\bar{d}(x_i,\mathbf{x}_{t_x})$ denote the mean dissimilarity between $x_i$ and all sites in type $t_x$.
The neighbor type of $x_i$, denoted as $b(x_i)$, is defined as the type (excluding $\tau(x_i)$) that minimizes the mean dissimilarity:
$$b(x_i)=\underset{x \in \tau \setminus \{\tau(x_i)\}}{argmin}\ \bar{d}(x_i,\mathbf{s}_{t_x})$$
The silhouette width quantifies how well $x_i$ fits within its assigned type compared to its neighbor type. For site $x_i$, it is computed as:   
$$sw(x_i) = \dfrac{\bar{d}(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{b(x_i)}) - \bar{d}(x_i,\mathbf{x}_{\tau(x_i)})}{max\big\{\bar{d}(x_i, \mathbf{x}_{b(x_i)}), \bar{d}(x_i,\mathbf{x}_{t_{\tau(x_i)}})\big\}}$$

The Average Silhouette Width (ASW) is calculated as the mean of individual silhouette  widths across all sites:
$$ASW = \dfrac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i=1}^N sw(x_i)$$
The ASW ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates the poorest possible type assignments and 1 represents optimal type assignments.

<!-- Classification Strength --> 
The Classification Strength [CS, @vansickleUsingMeanSimilarity1997] provides another measure to evaluate typology systems by comparing similarities within and among types.
Given a similarity matrix $\mathbf{S}$ with elements $s_{ij}$ where $i$ and $j$ index over sites, we define the within type similarity for type T as:
$$W_T = \dfrac{1}{K_T} \sum_{i = 1}^N \sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j \neq i}}^N s_{ij} \times \epsilon_{ij}$$

where $\epsilon_{ij} = 1$ if sites $i$ and $j$ both belong to type $T$ (i.e., $\tau(s_i)=\tau(s_j) = T$), and $0$ otherwise.
$K_T$ represents the total number of pairwise comparisons within type $T$, ensuring $W_T$ represents the mean similarity among sites of type $T$.
The among-type similarity for type $T$ is defined analogously: 
$$B_T = \dfrac{1}{L_T} \sum_{i = 1}^N \sum_{\substack{j = 1\\ j \neq i}}^N s_{ij} \times (1-\epsilon_{ij})$$ 
where $L_T$ is the number of comparisons between sites in type $T$ and sites in all other types
The type-specific classification strength is calculated as:
$$CS_t = W_t - B_t$$
This measure quantifies how much more similar sites are to others within their assigned type compared to sites in different types.
The difference to SW is, that CS considers all other types and not only the neighbor.
The Classification Strength for the complete typology system is computed as a weighted average of type-specific Classification Strengths:
$$CS = \sum_t^T \dfrac{n_t}{N} CS_t$$
where $n_t$ is the number of sites in type $t$ and $N$ is the total number of sites. 
Similar to the ASW, CS values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating more distinct and well-defined types.     

<!-- ANOSIM --> 
The Analysis of Similarities [ANOSIM, @clarkeNonparametricMultivariateAnalyses1993] evaluates typology systems using ranked similarities rather than raw similarity values. 
Let $\mathbf{S}_{rank}$ be the matrix of ranked similarities derived from $\mathbf{S}$, where lower ranks are assigned to higher similarities. 
For any pair of sites $(i,j)$, the element $s^{rank}{ij}$ represents the rank of the corresponding similarity $s_{ij}$.
We define $\bar{r}_W$ as the mean rank of within-type similarities and $\bar{r}_B$ as the mean rank of between-type similarities.
The ANOSIM R statistic is computed as:
$$R = (\bar{r}_B - \bar{r}_W)/(M/2)$$
where $M = N(N-1)/2$ 
Like ASW and CS, the ANOSIM R statistic ranges from -1 to 1.
A permutational *p*-value for R can be computed.     

Permutational multivariate analysis of variances [PERMANOVA, @andersonNewMethodNonparametric2001] evaluates typology systems by analyzing the variance in dissimilarities among sites.
For a dissimilarity matrix $\mathbf{D}$ with elements $d_{ij}$, we compute two sums of squares:
The total sum of squares: 
$$SS_{total} = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{N} d_{ij}^2$$

The within-type sum of squares:
$$SS_{within} = \dfrac{1}{N}\sum{i=1}^{N-1} \sum{j=i+1}^{N} d_{ij}\times \epsilon_{ij}$$

The pseudo F-ratio is then computed as:
$$F = \dfrac{SS_{within} / (T-1)}{SS_{total} / (N-T)}$$
Larger F-ratios indicate greater separation between type centroids in multivariate space. 
The statistical significance of the F-ratio can be assessed through a permutation test. 

<!-- non geometric methods --> 
Non-geometric measures evaluate typology systems directly from abundance or occurrence data, without requiring similarity metrics.
These include the indicator species analysis [IndVal, @dufreneSpeciesAssemblagesIndicator1997], Indicator Species Analysis Minimizing Intermediate Constancies [ISAMIC, @robertsLabdsvOrdinationMultivariate2023], and Area Under the ζ-diversity Decline Curve [AUCζ, @jupkeEuropeanRiverTypologies2023].    
<!--IndVal --> 
The indicator species analysis combines two components for each taxon $h$ in type $t$: concentration ($A_{ht}$) and relative frequency ($F_{ht}$). 
A perfect indicator (IndVal = 1.0) occurs exclusively in one type (perfect concentration) and is present in all samples of that type (maximum frequency).
For the group-equalized IndVal variant, which accounts for uneven sample sizes across types [@decaceresImprovingIndicatorSpecies2010], we compute the concentration component as:
$$A^g_{ht} = \frac{a^g_t}{a^g}$$
where $a^g_t = \frac{N}{k}\sum_{i \in t}(a_i/N_i)$ is the group-equalized sum of abundances in type $t$, and $a^g = \frac{N}{k}\sum_{i \in K}(a_i/N_i)$ is the total group-equalized abundance.
The frequency component as:
$$B_{ht} = \frac{n_{ht}}{N_t}$$
where $n_{ht}$ is the number of occurrences of taxon $h$ in type $t$, and $N_t$ is the total number of sites in type $t$.
The group-equalized IndVal for taxon $h$ in type $t$ is then:
$$IndVal^g_{ht} = \sqrt{A^g_{ht} \times B_{ht}} \times 100$$
For each species, only the highest IndVal is considered. 
$$IndVal^g_h = \max_{t}(IndVal^g_{ht})$$
Statistical significance of each IndVal is assessed through a permutation test. 
Since multiple tests are performed (one for each taxon), the resulting p-values are adjusted using Holm's step-down procedure to control for multiple comparisons [@westfallResamplingbasedMultipleTesting1993].
Two metrics evaluate the overall quality of the typology system:
1. The proportion of significant indicator taxa (at $\alpha = 0.05$), denoted as $N_{sig}$:
$$N_{sig}=\frac{1}{H}\sum_{h=1}{H}I(p_h<0.05)$$
where $I()$ is the indicator function, $H$ the number of species and $p_h$ is the adjusted p-value for taxon $h$. 
2. The mean adjusted p-value across all taxon-type combinations:
$$\bar{p} = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^H p_h$$

A superior typology system is characterized by a higher $N_{sig}$ and a lower $\bar{p}$. 

The Indicator Species Analysis Minimizing Intermediate Constancies (ISAMIC) evaluates how consistently species occur within types. 
For each taxon $h$ and type $t$, we calculate:
$$ISAMIC = \frac{\sum_{h=1}^{H}\left\{\left(2\sum_{t=1}^{T}|F_{ht}-0.5|\right)/T\right\}}{N}$$ 
The metric quantifies the predictability of species occurrence patterns.
Values close to 1 indicate that species tend to be either consistently present or consistently absent within types
Values close to 0 indicate that species occurrences are unpredictable, with frequencies close to 0.5
Higher ISAMIC values suggest a more effective typology system.

The Area Under the Zeta diversity Curve [AUCζ, @jupkeEuropeanRiverTypologies2023] quantifies the rate at which the number of shared taxa decreases along an increasing number of sampling sites. 
The zeta (ζ) diversity of degree $q$ represents the mean number of species shared across $q$ sites [@huiZetaDiversityConcept2014].
$$\zeta_q = \mathbb{E}\left[\bigcap_{j=1}^q y_j\right]$$
where $y_j$ represents the set of species in site $j$.
For any typology system, we compute the ζ-diversity within-types $\zeta^w_q$ using sites from the same type
and the ζ-diversity between-types $\zeta^b_q$ using sites from different types.
As ζ-diversity declines monotonically with increasing $q$, we can compute the area under the decline curves to quantify the speed and magnitude of turnover. 
The AUCζ for is calculated as:
$$AUC\zeta^w = \frac{1}{\zeta_1}\sum_{q=2}^{10} \frac{\zeta^w_i + \zeta^w_{i-1}}{2}$$
$$AUC\zeta^b = \frac{1}{\zeta_1}\sum_{q=2}^{10} \frac{\zeta^b_i + \zeta^b_{i-1}}{2}$$
We divide by $\zeta_1$ to obtain results that are independent of species richness. 
The effectiveness of a typology system can be quantified by the ratio:
$$\Delta AUC\zeta = \frac{AUC\zeta^w}{AUC\zeta^b}$$
where values > 1 indicate lower turnover within types than between types.

Lastly, we will compute one evaluation metric for a fuzzy classification. 
Using gradual instead of binary type-membership, such classifications offer advantages for capturing ecological gradients  but are less commonly used. 
The evaluation criteria we have discussed thus far assume crisp classifications and cannot be applied to fuzzy classifications. 
Therefore, we will use two approaches specific to fuzzy classifications. 
To our knowledge, these approaches have not been previously applied to bio validation of typology systems. 

Our first approach involves fitting binomial multiresponse GLMs [@wangMvabundPackageModelbased2012] using the presence-absence data as response variables and the type-membership as explanatory variables. 
This method shows how much of the variation in biota can be explained by the type-memberships. 
We will quantify the model fit with the weighted average if explained deviance across all taxa.
The deviances are weighted by the total number of taxon occurrences to prevent an undue influence of rare species. 
The best possible score is a 1, indicating the type-membership is able to perfectly predict the occurrence probability of every species. 
The worst score is 0, indicating the type-membership is independent of occurrence probabilities of all taxa. 

Our second approach consist of comparing the similarity of two communities in biological space (i.e., their Jaccard distance based on community composition) with the distance in type-membership space, i.e., the Jensen-Shannon distance between their type-membership vectors. This comparison will be achieved with a Mantel test [@mantelDetectionDiseaseClustering1967] which computes the Pearson correlation between values in the distance matrices.
